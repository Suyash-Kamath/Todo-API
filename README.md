# Todo-API

The Todo-API is a simple RESTful backend built with Node.js that allows users to manage their todo tasks. This API provides a set of endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on todo items. The project is designed to serve as the backend for any Todo application, focusing on handling task data efficiently and securely.

The main features of the Todo-API include:

GET /todos: Retrieve a list of all todos stored in the application.
GET /todos/:id: Retrieve a specific todo by its unique ID.
POST /todos: Create a new todo with a title and description.
PUT /todos/:id: Update an existing todoâ€™s title or description.
DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a specific todo by its unique ID.
